Hard limits Can cgroups limit I/O devices/operations usable by a process? _____ Yes Can cgroups limit network bandwidth usable by a process? _____ Yes The file /proc/[pid]/cgroup contains the process's _____ enclosing control group _____ allow you to set resource limits on processes and their children. cgroups _____ cgroup limits are not enforced. soft The _____ (crowd control) cgroup allows to freeze/thaw a group of processes, much like it is done by SIGSTOP signals. Unlike signals however, it CANNOT be detected by the processes. This is useful for cluster batch scheduling and process migration. Doesn't impede ptrace/debugging. freezer Can cgroups limit memory usable by a process? _____ Yes Each cgroup can have its own _____ or hard limits soft The _____ cgroup controls what a group can do what on device nodes (read/write/mknod permissions etc). You can do it on /dev/net/tun, /dev/fuse, /dev/kvm, /dev/dri so you can have network interface manipulation, filesystems in user space, VMs and GPUs inside containers.
